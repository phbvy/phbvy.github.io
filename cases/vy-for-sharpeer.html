            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Problem Description:</h2>
            <p>Sharpeer is a project I did as part of my bachelor's degree in Creative Technology Management to solve a problem for fellow students in my program. Creative Technology Management offers an interdisciplinary education intersecting Design, Technology and Management. Sometimes, the various possibilities offered by this major causes students in the program some confusion on what career to pursue and how to pursue it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="space-y-8">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Process:</h2>
            <p>
                As students of Creative Technology Management, the Sharpeer team (then unnamed) have heard or been a part of a conversation where fellow students display concerns about what to pursue for their future, citing the various possibility provided by their interdisciplinary background in Design, Technology and Management as one of the reasons. The Sharpeer team set out to interview Creative Technology Management students to understand this problem in-dept. The team defines our Problem Statement as follows: "Amongst students majoring in the interdisciplinary program of Creative Technology Management where Design, Technology and Business intersects, a common concern is that while students are capable individuals with ability to work in cross-functional teams, many cannot decide which specialized career path they could pursue in the future."

        <div class="space-y-4"> 


    
            <p>We then work on creating a solution that would address the Problem Statement defined above. Only then, the team was officially named Sharpeer, which comes from a combination of Sherpa/Shape and Career. Specifically, Sherpa people are mountain guides from Nepal. Similarly, Sharpeer aspires to be the guide that help young adults conquer the the task of shaping their career.</p>

            <p>Sharpeer aims to reflect a professional look to establish trust because career planning can have life-changing effects on individualsâ€™ life. Considering the age of our target users, Sharpeer should also have a friendly image to appeal to young audience as well as avoid the stress usually associated to career planning.</p>
            <p>To convey a professional and trustable look, Sharpeer chose navy as the primary color. This color resembles those of prestigious and long-standing institutions from both the academic and professional worlds such as Yale University, Columbia University, IBM, Boeing, ... which also represents the transition of the students from academic to professional world. To reflect a friendly and refreshing look, Sharpeer incorporates orange as a complimentary color which is not too aggressive and works harmoniously with navy.</p>

                <p>Based on the research on what users need to plan and accomplish their career goal, the team came up with three major features for Sharpeer:</p>

                <p>As we aim to provide a solution that can provide close guidance in each step of the student's path to their future career, Sharpeer allows the users to plan each potential career paths with concrete steps that they need to accomplish to pursue each. Such steps usually involve gaining expertise in relevant areas and getting certification of tests to display their competency - the milestones that they need to accomplish to build a specific career. Alongside with user interview results, I conducted desk research on the necessary milestones such as certification, tests and their structure for this feature. I was then responsible for developing a cohesive Information Architecture for Sharpeer that ties together the various features and information included in the app.</p>

        <p>The team then proceeded with the UI design of the Sharpeer app with me being the sole UI designer (with the other member's feedbacks and inputs).</p>
        <img class="rounded-xl" src="case-img/sharpeer-7.png">

        <p>I also created prototype of the app in two specific scenarios to demonstrate the app concept to others.</p>
