        <div class="space-y-2">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Problem Description:</h2>
            <p>PUBLY, a Korean startup, was looking to launch their professional networking and knowledge-sharing platform - Careerly, in Vietnam. PUBLY already established some reputation in this market with a newsletter on Product Management and wanted to build an early adopters waitlist for Careerly Vietnam from its newsletter readers. The goal was to attract a quality group of early adopters not many adopters.</p>
            <p>I helped PUBLY conduct UX research, designed and implemented a landing page for Careerly Vietnamâ€™s early adopter waitlist.</p>

            <p>Desk research has lead the team to decide on using a landing page as the final touchpoint for newsletter readers to sign up as early users of Careerly Vietnam. I was tasked to design and implement the landing page.</p>
            <p>The team operates with the Agile model and wanted to move fast. Therefore, many iterations of interface design were published as research and validation activities were happening.</p>

            <p>The first iteration was quickly published using a no-code platform to optimize development and update release time. I used a combination of various methods of research and reflected the learned insights in each iterations.</p>

            <p>During the development of the new identity:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc">
                <li>User Interviews with Newsletter readers were conducted to understand more about the readers' backgrounds - who are they and who would be more likely to adopt the Careerly Vietnam apps. The UI and UX writings were updated to appeal to this group. The insights learned is also communicated to other functions to be leveraged for other purposes such as product strategies and marketing planning.</li>
                <li>New iterations were released with A/B testing to determine if the changes actually brought about improvement.</li>
                <li>The landing pages were also used in social media ads. The performance metrics from Facebook Ads Manager were also leveraged to get more quantitative data on demographics.</li>
                <li>Heat maps were set up using Hotjar to understand users' interaction with the landing page. The insights were used to optimize the location of CTA.</li>
